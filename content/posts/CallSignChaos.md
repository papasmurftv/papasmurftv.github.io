## Overview {#overview}

Call Sign Chaos reflects on Jim Mattis's near 4 decades of experience in service to our country.  The book is divided into 3 parts: direct leadership, executive leadership, and strategic leadership. Jim Mattis recalls his lessons learned from Vietnam, Dessert Storm, Afghanistan, Iraq, NATO, Joint Forces Command, CENTCOM, and US Secretary of Defense.

I wanted to compile a list of quotes from this book that stood out to me.

> Because a unit adopts the personality of its commander, just as a sports team adopts the personality of its coach, I made the expectation clear: I wanted a bias for action, and to bring out the initiative in all hands.  I would make do with what I had, and not waste time whining about what I didn't have. (21)
